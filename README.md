## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Amazon’s discount strategies**, customer ratings, and product feedback across various categories. The goal is to understand **how discounts affect revenue, sales volume, and customer satisfaction** to help optimize Amazon’s pricing strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Assess the **effectiveness of different discount levels** in driving revenue.
- Analyze **the relationship between discounts, product ratings, and sales performance**.
- Identify **which product categories benefit most from discounts**.
- Examine **customer feedback** to uncover common complaints affecting low-rated products.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, WordCloud)
- **Data Cleaning & Aggregation**
- **Correlation & Price Elasticity Analysis**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Customer Reviews**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🔑 Key Findings
### 📉 **Discount Effectiveness**
- **20-40% discounts are the most effective** at balancing revenue and customer appeal.
- **Deep discounts (60%+) offer diminishing returns**, particularly for high-ticket items like electronics.
- **Higher discounts correlate with lower ratings**, suggesting that **discounts are often applied to lower-quality products**.

### 🔍 **Category-Specific Insights**
- **Electronics revenue declines slightly** with discounts, indicating **inelastic demand**.
- **Office Products maintain high ratings** with lower discounts, emphasizing **quality over price**.
- **Computers & Accessories show moderate benefit from discounts**, while **Home & Kitchen results are mixed**.

### 📝 **Customer Feedback Analysis**
- **Frequent product quality issues** (e.g., *"defective product," "battery life," "product not working"*) appear in low-rated reviews.
- **Packaging complaints** (*"sent without box," "used piece"*) contribute to negative customer experiences.
- Despite complaints, some reviews still highlight positive aspects (*"good product," "working fine"*) even in low ratings.

## ✅ Recommendations
- **Focus discounts in the 20-40% range** for optimal revenue impact.
- **Reduce over-discounting in Electronics** and shift to **value-based promotions** like:
  - **Bundling** (e.g., laptop + accessories)
  - **Financing options** (0% installment plans)
  - **Extended warranties**
- **Strengthen quality control** in categories with frequent product defects.
- **Improve packaging and fulfillment** to prevent complaints about damaged or used products.
- **Leverage verified reviews** to increase trust, especially for price-sensitive categories.
